Create a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items
Find the Mean Value
Find the Median Value
Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.

Output:
For Mode:
Enter the number of elements you wish to enter: 
10
---------------------------------------
You can enter the array elements:
12 23 34 33 12 34 45 34 66 56
12 23 34 33 12 34 45 34 66 56 Select from the following...
-----------------------------------------
1. Find the mean:
2. Find the median:
3. Find the mode:
3
The mode is: 34.0

For Median:
Enter the number of elements you wish to enter: 
5
---------------------------------------
You can enter the array elements:
12 22 34 11 22
12 22 34 11 22 Select from the following...
-----------------------------------------
1. Find the mean:
2. Find the median:
3. Find the mode:
2
The median is: 34.0

For Mean:
Enter the number of elements you wish to enter: 
5
---------------------------------------
You can enter the array elements:
23 11 44 56 34 
23 11 44 56 34 Select from the following...
-----------------------------------------
1. Find the mean:
2. Find the median:
3. Find the mode:
1
The mean is: 33.6
